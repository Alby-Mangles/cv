      <p><em>Founder and CEO of <strong><a href="https://www.fieldql.com">Field</a></strong></em></p>
      <p>Alister is the founder and CEO of Field, and left senior legal roles in private practice and in-house to tackle one of
        the real challenges of the 'new law' age: how to leverage legal contracts to deliver genuine value to their parties.
        He loves to learn, build and share, and do things that make a difference. In his other life, Alister tries his best to be a
        decent dad and husband, and tries (unsuccessfully) to stay fit enough to keep up with his 2 boys.</p>
